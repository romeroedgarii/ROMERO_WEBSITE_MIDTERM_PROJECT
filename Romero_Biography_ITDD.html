        <p> 
            <sup><b>1</b></sup>I am <b>Edgar II G. Romero</b>, born on October 15, 1999, in Quezon City, Metro Manila. <sup><b>2</b></sup>At a young age, I was surrounded by music, creativity, and a family filled with love. <sup><b>3</b></sup>I come from a big family where my parents, sisters, brother, and I shared countless joyful memories. <sup><b>4</b></sup>Many of these moments were spent cuddled together on our big bed right in front of the TV, watching movies and musicals. <sup><b>5</b></sup>Classics like <i>"The Sound of Music," "Sister Act" 1-3, "Home Alone" 1-3,</i> the <i>"Harry Potter"</i> films, and Disney musicals were staples of our bonding time. <sup><b>6</b></sup>These shows did more than entertain; they helped develop my English skills and sparked my love for storytelling and artistry. <sup><b>7</b></sup>My dad, often like <emp>Captain Von Trapp</emp>, would pick up his guitar, and we would all gather around on the floor to sing along as he played songs by <i>The Beatles, Bee Gees, Abba</i>, and <i>Queen</i>. <sup><b>8</b></sup>The music filled our home with joy and connection. <sup><b>9</b></sup>Singing together was second nature to us, and every family gathering felt like a mini-concert. <sup><b>10</b></sup>One unforgettable tradition was my performance of Tina Turner’s <i>“Proud Mary”</i>, which became a staple at family events. <sup><b>11</b></sup>Despite being an introverted child who preferred solving puzzles or getting lost in shows rather than playing with cousins, my parents encouraged me to share my talents publicly. <sup><b>12</b></sup>Beyond family gatherings, my cousins and I would often participate in <i>barangay</i> singing and dancing competitions, where we proudly showcased our talents to the local community. <sup><b>13</b></sup>These events were filled with vibrant energy, excitement, and a sense of accomplishment when our hard work paid off on stage. <sup><b>14</b></sup>Even as a shy kid, those competitions helped me grow more confident in front of an audience. <sup><b>15</b></sup>Winning or losing didn’t matter as much as the joy of performing together and representing our family. <sup><b>16</b></sup>My siblings and I found creative ways to bond, whether through music, storytelling, or simply spending time together drawing and painting. I’ve always had a passion for art and loved creating colorful pieces, which my family always appreciated. <a href="IMAGES/bioimage2.jpg" target="winImage"><img src="IMAGES/bioimage2.jpg" alt="An image of young Edgar II with his 3 other siblings, sharing a bed." class="right1" title="An image of young Edgar II with his 3 other siblings, sharing a bed." /> </a><br>
            <sup><b>17</b></sup>My sisters often joined me in imaginative activities, while my brother had a knack for playful mischief that kept things lively. <sup><b>18</b></sup>We didn’t just share moments; we built countless stories filled with laughter and music. <sup><b>19</b></sup>My parents always emphasized that these creative outlets were: <cite><strong>"kasing halaga lang 'yan ng pag aaral, 'nak".</strong></cite> <sup><b>20</b></sup>Even on quiet days, music seemed to linger in our home, like a comforting background melody. <sup><b>21</b></sup>Those times taught me the value of self-expression, whether through song or brushstroke. <sup><b>22</b></sup>Looking back, I’m incredibly grateful for a childhood where music, creativity, and family love intertwined so beautifully. <sup><b>23</b></sup>These experiences remain some of my most cherished memories, shaping who I am today and continuing to inspire my passions.

        <p>
            <sup><b>1</b></sup>My teenage years were filled with growth, creativity, and unexpected triumphs as I studied at <i>Judge Feliciano Belmonte Sr. High School.</i> <sup><b>2</b></sup>With the artistry I had nurtured during my childhood, it didn’t take long for my teachers to notice my creative talents. <sup><b>3</b></sup>They encouraged me to represent the school in various poster-making competitions. <sup><b>4</b></sup>One of the most memorable was the <b>Nationwide Centennial Stamp Design Making Contest</b> for the Centennial Year celebration of the <em>Philippine National Bank</em>. <sup><b>5</b></sup>Out of about a hundred talented students, I won as a runner-up, an achievement that still stands as a proud moment for me. <sup><b>6</b></sup>Beyond visual arts, I explored more opportunities to express myself creatively. <sup><b>7</b></sup>I became a part of the Campus Journalists, serving as both an editorial cartoonist and an anchor for our school's radio broadcasting team. <sup><b>8</b></sup>Competing from the district level up to the national level, our team brought home numerous awards, contributing to the pride of our alma mater. <sup><b>9</b></sup>Despite being naturally introverted and often nervous in front of crowds, I constantly found myself pushing past my fears. <sup><b>10</b></sup>This realization hit me as I reflected on my high school journey—fear never stopped me from showing up and doing what I loved. <sup><b>11</b></sup>Singing, which had always been a major part of my life, pulled me toward the school's choir. <sup><b>12</b></sup>I auditioned as a tenor and made it through, marking the beginning of yet another chapter in my creative journey. <sup><b>13</b></sup>Joining my first choral competition was nerve-wracking but also incredibly fulfilling. <a href="IMAGES/bioimage4.jpg" target="winImage"><img src="IMAGES/bioimage4.jpg" alt="An image of teenage Edgar II, admiring his competitors artwork in the Centennial Stamp Design Contest, held for the Centennial Year celebration of the Philippine National Bank." class="right2" title="An image of teenage Edgar II, admiring his competitors artwork in the Centennial Stamp Design Contest, held for the Centennial Year celebration of the Philippine National Bank." /> </a> <br>
            
            <sup><b>14</b></sup>Balancing academics, journalism, broadcasting, and choir wasn’t easy, but these experiences shaped who I was becoming. <sup><b>15</b></sup>High school wasn’t just about grades for me—it was about learning and finding myself through these various creative pursuits. <sup><b>16</b></sup>I may not have graduated as an honor student, but I left with lessons and experiences that were just as valuable. <sup><b>17</b></sup>One of the most defining moments of my high school years was winning the <strong><em>Artist of the Year</em></strong> award. <sup><b>18</b></sup>It was a recognition that validated my hard work, passion, and creativity. <sup><b>19</b></sup>Receiving that award felt like a celebration of my journey—from a child performing in family events to an artist creating meaningful work for competitions and school activities. <sup><b>20</b></sup>Looking back, these teenage years taught me that success is not just measured by medals or titles but by how much you grow and push past the limits you once thought you had.

            <sup><b>1</b></sup>After high school, I was excited to move straight to college, but my plans took a detour when our batch became the first-ever to experience Senior High School. <sup><b>2</b></sup>In 2017, I only had one goal: to enter <i>Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP)</i> for Senior High School and continue there for college. <sup><b>3</b></sup>Thankfully, I got in and pursued the Tech-Voc ICT strand, where I learned programming languages like <i><b>Visual Basic, C++, C</b></i>, and <i><b>Java</b></i>. <sup><b>4</b></sup>Although my interest in technology grew, I chose a different path for college and entered <em>PUP’s College of Engineering and Architecture</em> to study <em>Bachelor of Science in Architecture.</em> <sup><b>5</b></sup>To relieve the stress that architecture brought me, I joined <i>Bagong Himig Serenata</i>, the university's choir. <sup><b>6</b></sup>Music had always been a refuge for me, and this choir became a sanctuary amid demanding studies. <sup><b>7</b></sup>At the same time, I got my first job as a <em>McDonald's</em> crew member, but I quickly realized how architecture demanded too much time and energy for me to balance work so I had to leave. <sup><b>8</b></sup>In 2019, my life took an unfortunate turn as I struggled emotionally and financially, lacking the support I needed from my family. <sup><b>9</b></sup>Unable to cope, I stopped college during my second year to find work and focus on healing myself. <sup><b>10</b></sup>I was fortunate to land a job as a <strong>Customer Service Representative</strong>, assisting international clients with telecommunications services. <sup><b>11</b></sup>Despite the onset of the pandemic, I kept my job and became the family’s financial backbone when no one else was working. <sup><b>12</b></sup>After half a year, the management recognized my potential and made me part of the training crew. <sup><b>13</b></sup>I eventually rose to <i><strong>Senior Representative</strong></i> and then <em><strong>Team Manager</strong></em>, where I led my own team. <sup><b>14</b></sup>However, after two and a half years, the monotony became unbearable, prompting me to switch to a better-paying role in digital real estate management in Metro Manila. <a href="IMAGES/bioimage8.jpg" target="winImage"><img src="IMAGES/bioimage8.jpg" alt="An image of Los Cantantes De Manila winning the Grand Prix at the 72nd Concorso Polifonico Internazionale Guido d'Arezzo in Arezzo, Italy." class="right3" title="An image of Los Cantantes De Manila winning the Grand Prix at the 72nd Concorso Polifonico Internazionale Guido d'Arezzo in Arezzo, Italy." /> </a> <br> <sup><b>15</b></sup>In 2022, I made a life-changing decision by joining the prestigious choir <em><strong>Los Cantantes de Manila</strong></em>. <sup><b>16</b></sup>Being surrounded by incredible singers pushed me to develop my musical skills and opened doors I never imagined possible. <sup><b>17</b></sup>One of the highlights was touring and competing across Europe, visiting countries like <em>Germany, Austria, Spain, Hungary, Italy,</em> and even <em>Russia</em>. <sup><b>18</b></sup>I often thought back to watching <i>Whoopi Goldberg</i> inspire a choir in <i>"Sister Act"</i>, never realizing that one day I would live a similar dream. <sup><b>19</b></sup>Traveling the world with <em>Los Cantantes de Manila</em> wasn’t just about singing, it reignited my aspirations and offered me a chance to return to school. <sup><b>20</b></sup>My choir master, who also serves as the choir director at the <strong><em>University of the East - Manila</em></strong>, encouraged me to pursue education again. <sup><b>21</b></sup>Now, as a proud UE Warrior studying <strong><em>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</em></strong>, I’ve come full circle. <sup><b>22</b></sup>While this path is far from architecture, it offers practical opportunities for my future and represents how resilience and passion can steer life toward new possibilities.
